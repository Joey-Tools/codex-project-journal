# Project Journal Trigger Refactor

## Summary

- Project journals now auto-apply only after repo policy or a valid tracked non-generated entry establishes adoption.
- A task spanning Codex sessions, a PR, or a durable workstream triggers an adoption assessment but does not authorize the first tracker; first adoption still requires an explicit product need.
- Automatic updates target the smallest applicable layer, while index generation and hook installation remain workflow-specific and opt-in.

## Current State

- The skill frontmatter, body, UI metadata, templates, migration guidance, helper, and tests implement the adoption boundary and preserve concise top-level tracker and squash-merge target-branch semantics.
- This is the repository's intentional first journal entry because the finalization task explicitly requires durable repo-owned validation and handoff evidence; no top-level tracker, generated index, or local hook is introduced.

## Next Steps

- None for this completed workstream.

## Evidence

- Implementation range: `15521e327477444bf11e8b83502720fe4237aa8c..a71fa8cb0261c6e04fc79e77cadc668498442b5c`.
- Focused adoption and trigger tests: 6 passed in 6.458 seconds with Python 3.13.0.
- Full test suite: 188 passed, 2 skipped in 239.691 seconds with Python 3.13.0.
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/project_journal.py tests/test_project_journal.py`: passed.
- `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` for the helper and tests: passed.
- Joey skill validation wrapper: 1 skill passed with no runtime errors.
- Project journal validation and `git diff --check`: passed.
